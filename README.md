# âš¡ Streamlit Dashboard v5 â€” Performance & Scale

This version of the dashboard demonstrates **scalable data exploration** in Python with **Streamlit** and **DuckDB**.  
It is designed to handle **large datasets (millions of rows)** while staying responsive.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Offline-safe demo data**  
  Uses Plotlyâ€™s built-in Gapminder dataset, scaled up to **1M+ rows** with jitter for realism.
- **File upload support**  
  Upload your own **CSV** or **Parquet** file, processed server-side in DuckDB.
- **Server-side filtering & pagination**  
  No need to load everything into memoryâ€”DuckDB executes efficient SQL queries on demand.
- **Performance caching**  
  Streamlitâ€™s `@st.cache_data` ensures queries and uploads donâ€™t rerun unnecessarily.
- **WebGL plotting**  
  Large scatterplots are smooth with Plotlyâ€™s `render_mode="webgl"`.
- **Virtualized tables**  
  Supports [AgGrid](https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid) for fast scrolling, with a fallback to `st.dataframe`.
- **Download support**  
  Export the currently visible page of data as CSV.
